                                             2
What is Linux?
 Linux is an open source free operating system based on Unix
 It was first developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991
 It is commonly used as a server operating system
 Most distributions come packaged with GNU tools, which are a set
 of open source productivity tools




                                                                    3
Why use Linux?
 Linux is very stable
 It is free
 It is open source meaning anyone can modify Linux
 It is maintained by a large community
 Very few system resources are required to properly operate most
 Linux distributions
 A GUI is not required to run a stable full featured Linux server
 (something Windows server is finally pushing towards)


                                                                    4
Do people really use Linux?
YES!

 It is used in many devices around the world
   Linux/Unix based operating systems make up about 70% of the
   Web Servers in the world
   Since Android also uses the Linux kernel it is also a popular
   mobile operating system
   Many networking devices are unix based
   A lot of small specialized devices are unix based (eg. GPSs, TVs)
   The top 500 super computers are running Linux
                                                                       5
Distributions
 A Linux Distribution is a collection of software packages including
 a package manager, combined with the Linux Kernel to be an
 Operating System
 Most of the Distributions are based on the following Linux
 distributions
   Debian
   Slackware
   Red Hat
   Arch
   Gentoo                                                              6
What distributions have you heard of?

                                                                7
Which distribution will we be using?
 CentOS
 CentOS is based on Red Hat Linux
   It also uses all the Red Hat repositories
   It removes all Red Hat branding
   It does not offer paid support like Red Hat




                                                 8
Planning a Linux Installation
 Choosing your installation media:
 https://www.centos.org/download/
   DVD ISO: Most common software available at installation
   Everything ISO: Meant for system admins who wish to install
   additional packages without downloading using the package
   manager for additional control
   Minimal ISO: Installs the bare minimum for your OS (Using in our
   labs)
 Should you upgrade or clean install?
   When doing a major version change its best to do a clean install   9
Planning a Linux Installation
 How would we install to bare metal?
   Create install media using YUMI or UUI (Windows)
      https://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/
   Startup Disk Creator (Linux)
   Create a CD or DVD of the ISO
   Net Install using a PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) Server
 Installing to a virtual machine is a matter of mounting the ISO as a
 CD drive

                                                                        10
CentOS System requirements
 In a Virtual Machine:
   15 GB of HDD
   1 GB of RAM
   1 vCPU core
 Bare Metal:
   15GB of HDD
   2 GB of RAM
   1 core CPU

                             11
What filesystems have you heard of?




                                      12
Hard drive setup
 The latest versions of Linux use the ext4 filesystem, xfs filesystem
 or zfs filesystem
 Partitions
   We need a root partition that will be mounted at /
   We are also going to separate our /boot partition
      /boot is where our boot configuration is stored
   We will also need a swap partition



                                                                        13
Recommended Partitions
 Recommended Scheme is to separate partition for each of the
 following
   /var
   /home
   /boot
   /tmp
   swap
 We'll learn more about each of these folders later

                                                               14
What is a swap partition?
 Swap is similar to Windows page file
 It is used if there is an additional need for RAM
 It is also used if there is information in RAM that is hardly ever
 used to free up additional space
 However you should consider swap like car insurance, you need to
 have it but you never want to use it
 Swap should be 1.5-2 times the size of your RAM



                                                                      15
How does Linux boot?
 GRUB = Grand Unified Bootloader
 Grub works in 3 stages
   Storing boot.img in the MBR at sector 0, this is configured to
   load core.img
   The core.img is stored in sector 1-62, since they are always
   empty. Once executed core.img will load its configuration file
   and other modules needed such as system drivers
   The final stage is loading the configuration from /boot/grub


                                                                    16
How does Linux boot? (Continued)
 While in GRUB you can hit the e key to enter additional parameters
 like kernel flags or different init program (more on this in the
 future)
 You can also select previous kernel versions in cases where there
 are stability issues with newer kernals
 In the event your boot ever gets corrupted you can use a tool called
 Super Grub Disk to boot any OS on your hard drives
   https://www.supergrubdisk.org/


                                                                        17
What is an init system?
 Linux can have daemons or services that start at system startup
 When a Linux system is started the first process that is run is run
 under process id (pid) 1 and that process is the init system
 Depending on the init system, daemons will be started sequentially
 or in parallel and with various options
 Common init systems include:
   systemd (most common on modern systems)
   sysVinit (oldest and most stable)
   runit
   OpenRC                                                              18
How does the Linux GUI work?
 Linux uses an X11 server to draw and display windows, this is
 historically based on having one Linux hosting multiple terminals
 and one server
 In the future X11 could be changed to wayland as some
 distributions have already adopted wayland
 X11 also allows you to transmit windows over remote connections
 without sharing your whole desktop




                                                                     19
Do we need to use a GUI in Linux?
NO!

 We won't be using a GUI in lab
 Why not you might ask?
      Once you get used to command line its far more efficient for
      server management, especially remote management
      If you run a GUI then there is additional unnecessary software
      that could potentially have errors



                                                                       20
Linux on your Laptop or Desktop
 Are you ready to dive into Linux and try it on your computer
 If you are then I wouldn't recommend CentOS for your desktop,
 instead I would recommend MX Linux
   https://mxlinux.org/
   MX Linux is a very user friendly and stable desktop distribution
   It is debian based
 The reason we aren't using MX Linux in lab is because it is designed
 to be a Desktop Operating System and comes with additional
 software we don't need on a server
                                                                        21
Using a Linux Terminal on Windows with MSYS2
 Linux terminal for windows with MSYS2
   https://www.msys2.org/
 The package manager for MSYS2 is pacman. Usage samples:
   Install: pacman -S <package name>
   Upgrading: pacman -Syuu
   Searching for packages: pacman-Ss <name pattern>




                                                           22
Using a Linux Terminal on Windows with MSYS2

 MSYS2 Usage examples:
   grep
   vim
   ssh
 MSYS2 Usage windows command:
   *WMIC PATH Win32_Battery Get EstimatedChargeRemaining *



                                                             23
Installing an X11 Server on Windows
 XWindows for windows - XMING:
 https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/
   X Window System - is the Unix windowing system, it provides a
   framework for a GUI environment
   It allows for drawing and moving windows as well as interacting
   with mouse, keyboard and a display device
 Once XMING is installed one Windows you can use GUI
 applications remotely through SSH


                                                                     24
